# JPMorgan & Chase Co. Virtual Internship Program on Forage

In this job simulation I performed some of the tasks that an Information Security Analyst would at JPMorgan & Chase Co. There are 4 tasks; the first is using Python to find fraud in a large financial transactions dataset; the second is setting up and hardening a Django web server with 2FA; the third is coding, training and testing a Machine Learning Classification Algorithm to detect spam email; last, but not least, leveraging Python to script a Role Based Access Control mechanism.
